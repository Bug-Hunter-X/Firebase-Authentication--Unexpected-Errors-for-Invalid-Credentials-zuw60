The Firebase Authentication SDK might throw an unexpected error if the provided email/password combination is incorrect, especially when dealing with custom token authentication or when the authentication provider is not properly configured.  This may manifest as a generic error message, rather than a specific 'user not found' or 'wrong password' message, making debugging more challenging.  The error message might not clearly pinpoint the authentication failure.
